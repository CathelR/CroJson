This is a simple learning project.

Its inspired by cJson, and is a simple library which will basically allow for .NET Core style appsettings.json files to be used with C projects.
It is not now, (and likely never will be) a fully featured JSON library, and I don't intend for it to meet the full requirements of the JSON standard.
